=head1 NAME

zgz - libz based gz creator

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<zgz> [options] file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

zgz is a modified version of a BSD gzip program. Unlike gzip(1), it
uses libz for compression.

BSD gzip is a drop-in replacement for GNU gzip(1). You can refer to GNU gzip's
manpage for the command-line arguments.
However, this is a modified version that removes support for some options, most
notably decompression (-d) and recursive (-r).

This version supports a variety of special options which aid pristine-gz(1) in
reproducing builds of gz files that are bit-identical to the originals.
