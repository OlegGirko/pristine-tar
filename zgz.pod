=head1 NAME

zgz - libz based gz creator

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<zgz> [options] file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

zgz is a modified version of a BSD gzip program. Unlike gzip(1), it
uses libz for compression.

It supports a variety of special, and currently unducumented options which
aid pristine-gz(1) in reproducing builds of gz files that are bit-identical
to the originals.
