pristine-tar (0.2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Added pristine-gz.
  * Added bsd-gzip, modified by paravoid to support gzip's (undocumented) -m
    and -M timestamp setting options. This will be needed when regenerating gz
    files created on bsd systems since the compression algorythm differs.
  * Renamed the subcommands extract => gentar , stash => gendelta
