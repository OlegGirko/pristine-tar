pristine-tar (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * pristine-tar sometimes got confused about tarballs that did not unpack
    all files into a subdir. Fixes sear-media and 30 others.
  * tar was confused by files starting with ./ or / in the manifest, so
    strip it out. Fixes erlang-doc-html and 19 others, including doc-fdc,
    which is the only package to have files in / in its tarball.
  * Some tarballs put files in a subdir, but don't show a "/" after the subdir
    name in a manifest. Stop relying on that. (example: streamtuner)
  
  Current stats: Out of the whole debian archive, pristine-gz fails
  on 132 files, and pristine-tar fails on 0. Success with 98.97% of
  files.

pristine-tar (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added pristine-gz, thanks to paravoid for making this possible!
  * Added zgz, which is derived from a BSD gzip program that uses libz.
    Modified by paravoid to support many options needed to reproduce gz
    files.
  * Renamed the subcommands extract => gentar , stash => gendelta
  * Quite a lot of testing (ie, on the entire Debian archive) and bugfixes.
  * Put files in the generated tarball mode 0644 pre-delta, this is a much
    more likely file mode than the previous 0000 and thus makes the delta
    smaller.
  * File format version is up to 2.0 due to misc incompatible changes.
  * Fix a bug related to tar's handling of unicode filenames.
  * Work around a strange tar behavior: When run with --mode 644, tar
    preserves the sgid bit on subdirectories.

  Current stats: Out of the whole debian archive, pristine-gz fails
  on 131 files, and pristine-tar fails on 45. Success with 98.63% of
  files.
