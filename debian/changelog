pristine-tar (0.7) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Improve/fix handling when there is no local pristine-tar branch.

pristine-tar (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improve search for upstream branch. Default to looking for first
    refs/heads/upstream, and failing that, anything with "upstream" in its
    name. This way if there is a local upstream branch and a remote one, it
    will use the local one. If there's only a remote one, it'll use that.
    Closes: #463566
  * Handle the case where there is no local pristine-tar branch. If there
    is exactly one remote branch, use it for checkout. If more than one or
    none, show a nice error message. (Cyril Brulebois)

pristine-tar (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved to git, and added a Vcs-Browser field.
  * pristine-tar can now "commit" deltas for a tarball directly to a git
    branch, and then "checkout" the original tarball again. Git users
    are recommended to use these new subcommands because they're easier,
    store the deltas in a consistent location, and avoid problems with
    recreating things like empty directories that git doesn't track.
    Closes: #463352
  * Thanks to madcoder for help with manipulating git branches without
    touching the working copy.
  * Fix paranoia check in pristine-gz to correctly handle parameters
    that take an option.

pristine-tar (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow the delta file to be read or written from stdio.
  * Fix man page synopses formatting.

pristine-tar (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * pristine-tar sometimes got confused about tarballs that did not unpack
    all files into a subdir. Fixes sear-media and 30 others.
  * tar was confused by files starting with ./ or / in the manifest, so
    strip it out. Fixes erlang-doc-html and 19 others, including doc-fdc,
    which is the only package to have files in / in its tarball.
  * Some tarballs put files in a subdir, but don't show a "/" after the subdir
    name in a manifest. Stop relying on that. (example: streamtuner)
  
  Current stats: Out of the whole debian archive, pristine-gz fails
  on 132 files, and pristine-tar fails on 0. Success with 98.97% of
  files.

pristine-tar (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added pristine-gz, thanks to paravoid for making this possible!
  * Added zgz, which is derived from a BSD gzip program that uses libz.
    Modified by paravoid to support many options needed to reproduce gz
    files.
  * Renamed the subcommands extract => gentar , stash => gendelta
  * Quite a lot of testing (ie, on the entire Debian archive) and bugfixes.
  * Put files in the generated tarball mode 0644 pre-delta, this is a much
    more likely file mode than the previous 0000 and thus makes the delta
    smaller.
  * File format version is up to 2.0 due to misc incompatible changes.
  * Fix a bug related to tar's handling of unicode filenames.
  * Work around a strange tar behavior: When run with --mode 644, tar
    preserves the sgid bit on subdirectories.

  Current stats: Out of the whole debian archive, pristine-gz fails
  on 131 files, and pristine-tar fails on 45. Success with 98.63% of
  files.
