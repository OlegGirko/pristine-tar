pristine-tar (0.2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Added pristine-gz, thanks to paravoid for making this possible!
  * Added zgz, which is derived from a BSD gzip program that uses libz.
    Modified by paravoid to support many options needed to reproduce gz
    files.
  * Renamed the subcommands extract => gentar , stash => gendelta
  * Quite a lot of testing (ie, on the entire Debian archive) and bugfixes.
  * Put files in the generated tarball mode 0644 pre-delta, this is a much
    more likely file mode than the previous 0000 and thus makes the delta
    smaller.
  * File format version is up to 2.0 due to misc incompatible changes.
