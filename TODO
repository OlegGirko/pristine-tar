* regenerate the pristine .gz too, if possible
* Would be nice to keep a md5sums list of the files in the manifest and
  check and error if any are different. The error message from xdelta when
  a source file doesn't have the right checksup is fairly obscure and
  doesn't aid in fixing the problem.
